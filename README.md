# Unstructured-proxy
<a name="unstructured-proxy"/>

```unstructured-proxy``` is a prototype who addresses some limitations existing in the [OpenZeppelin-sdk](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-sdk) implementation. It was my full first prototype in Solidity and Web3 who let me dig deaply the way Ethereum Smart Contracts are working. The code is compiled against the Solidity 0.5. compiler.
